# STEP 1: Structural identifiability and observability analysis

This folder contains files that reproduce the results of the structural identifiability and observability analyses of the two case studies. 

The results can be reproduced simply by running the two MATLAB Live Scripts (*.mlx) found in this folder. The scripts call **STRIKE-GOLDD**, a MATLAB toolbox provided as a submodule in this repository. No separate installation is necessary: the scripts automatically add all the necessary paths.

For convenience, pdf versions of the scripts are also provided.
